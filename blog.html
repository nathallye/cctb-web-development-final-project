          <img src="" alt="">

          <div>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>3 overripe medium bananas, mashed</li>
              <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
              <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
              <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
              <li>2 eggs, room temperature</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
              <li>1/2 cup greek yogurt</li>
              <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
              <li>1 1/4 cups all purpose flour</li>
              <li>2/3 cup chocolate chips or mixed nuts, roughly chopped</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Preheat oven to 350ÂºF. Grease a 9 x 5 inch loaf pan and set aside.
              </li>
              <li>
                In a large bowl, whisk together mashed bananas with the melted butter, stirring 
                to combine. Add the brown sugar and white sugar. Whisk to combine. Add the 
                greek yogurt, eggs, and vanilla extract and whisk until fully combined.
              </li>
              <li>
                In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. Fold the dry 
                ingredients into the wet. Do not over mix! Fold the chocolate chips/nuts in last, 
                folding a few times until just combined.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bake for 50 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. 
                Allow to cool for 15 minutes before removing from loaf pan and serving!
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Notes:</h4>
            <p>
              If the top of the bread is browning too fast, cover the bread with tinfoil and place back in the 
              oven to finish baking
